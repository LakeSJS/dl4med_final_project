/gpfs/data/oermannlab/users/slj9342/.conda/envs/dl4med_25/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:425: The 'val_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=15` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.
